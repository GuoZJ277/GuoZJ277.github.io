I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Internal Medicine(Nephrology) at the [Peking University First Hospital](https://www.pkufh.com/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Luxia Zhang](https://www.nihds.pku.edu.cn/en/info/1027/1002.htm). My research interests include AI for prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease, exploration of markers for the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease.
